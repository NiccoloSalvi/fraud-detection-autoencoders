# 🛡️ Fraud Detection in Credit Card Transactions

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a replication of the paper **"Combining Autoencoders and Deep Learning for Effective Fraud Detection in Credit Card Transactions"**. The goal is to explore **anomaly detection techniques** using **deep learning and autoencoders** to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.

## 🚀 Objectives
- Implement **autoencoders** for fraud detection.
- Apply **deep learning** models to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
- Evaluate performance using appropriate **metrics**.
